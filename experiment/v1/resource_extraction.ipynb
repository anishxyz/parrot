V1 Knowledge bases interacted with natural language, V1 vector stores interacted with         chunks and embeddings, and V1 data connectors set up automatic ingestion pipelines with third         party data sources.\\n- In V2, all data ingestion is done through knowledge bases.

To use         this API, specify the `knowledge_base_id` of the knowledge base you want to query, pass in         the natural language `query` that you want to search for, specify the value `top_k`,         which is the number of similar chunks that will be returned, and specify whether you want         the returned chunks to `include_embeddings`.\\n\\nSimilarity search is used to efficiently find, retrieve, and rank chunks based on their         similarity to a given query, which is also expressed as an embedding. Similarity scores (         using the cosine similarity metric) are calculated between each chunk embedding and the         embedded query, and the chunks are ranked based on similarity score. The top-ranked chunks         are returned as the query results.\\n\\nWe are using the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm to perform a k nearest         neighbors search in the vector space. This algorithm returns an estimate of the best k         nearest neighbors and is optimized for datasets with hundreds of thousands of vectors.

For example, this API may be useful         when doing retrieval augment generation (RAG).

A chunk is simply a fragment of a larger document.         It can optionally have its own metadata or ID.         You can also construct your own chunks from scratch so long as you provide the text         pertaining to each chunk.\\n\\nSynthesizing chunks can be thought of as the final step in a retrieval augmented generation (         RAG) system, after querying for chunks and potentially [ranking them](         https://scale-egp.readme.io/reference/rank_chunks).         Once you have the relevant chunks to use to respond to the user, you\\'ll want to synthesize a         readable natural language answer.         During this synthesis step, we prompt an LLM with instructions and a set of (possibly         transformed) chunks to guide it toward synthesizing a natural language response to the user         query.\\n\\nThere are several synthesis strategies, whose difference become more apparent as the number         of chunks increases.         Currently, EGP supports the `compact` strategy by default: stuff as many chunks into the         synthesis LLM as possible, produce a best-effort answer, then continue to stuff and answer         the next set of chunks.         The answer is passed through and gradually refined with each iteration of chunk scanning.         This continues until all chunks have been scanned and a final answer is synthesized.         More synthesis strategies are currently in development!\\n\\n### Restrictions and Limits\\nGenerally, chunk synthesis increases its token consumption linearly the number of         chunk-tokens.\\nThe `compact` strategy attempts to be as token-efficient as possible by stuffing tokens into         each round of chunk scanning.         Other strategies (in development!) may produce better summaries or more precise answers at         the expense of more tokens consumed.\\n\\nBroadly, we recommend keeping the number of chunks to under 100, or the total number of         tokens across all chunks under around 10,000.'}},\n",

Given a list of messages and a list of tools to ask         for help from, the Agent will either respond with a final answer directly or ask the user to         execute a tool to provide more information.\\n\\n### Details\\nAn Agent is a component that utilizes a Language Model (LLM) as an interpreter and decision         maker. Unlike asking an LLM for a direct response, communicating with an agent consists of a         running dialogue where an agent can optionally ask the user to execute specialized tools for         specific tasks, such as calculations, web searches, or accessing custom data from private         knowledge bases.\\n\\nAn agent is designed to be stateless, emitting outputs one step at a time. This means that         client-side applications are responsible for managing message history, tool execution,         and responses. This grants users greater flexibility to write and execute custom tools         and maintain explicit control over their message history.\\n\\n#### Message Types\\n- `User Message`: A message from the user to the agent.\\n- `System Message`: An informational text message from the system to guide the agent. It is         not a user message or agent message because it did not come from either entity.\\n- `Agent Message`: A message from the agent to the client. It will contain either a final         answer as `content` or a request for the user to execute a tool as a `tool_request`.\\n- `Tool Message`: A message from the user to the agent that contains the output of a tool         execution. The tool message will be processed by the agent and the agent will respond with         either a final answer or another tool request.\\n\\n#### Agent Instructions\\nInstructions are used to guide the agent's decision making process and output generation.\\n\\nGood prompt engineering is crucial to getting performant results from the agent. If you are         having trouble getting the agent to perform well, try writing more specific instructions         before trying more expensive techniques such as swapping in other models or finetuning the         underlying LLM.\\n\\nFor example, the default instructions we set for the agent are the following:\\n\\n> You are an AI assistant that helps users with their questions. You can answer questions         directly or acquire information from any of the attached tools to assist you. Always answer         the user's most recent query to the best of your knowledge.<br>\\n> When asked about what tools are available, you must list each attached tool's name         and description. When asked about what you can do, mention that in addition to your normal         capabilities, you can also use the attached tools by listing their names and descriptions.         You cannot use any other tools other than the ones provided to you explicitly.\\n\\n\\n### Restrictions and Limits\\n**Message Limits**:\\n  - The message list is not limited by length, but by the context limit of the underlying           language model. If you are getting an error regarding the underlying model's context           limit, try using a memory strategy to condense the input messages.\\n\\n**Model Restrictions**:\\n  - Currently, only closed source models like GPT and Claude are supported due to the           limitations of open source models when it comes to tool selection, generating tool           arguments in valid JSON, and planning out multi-step tool execution. Specialized           fine-tuning will likely be required to make open source models compatible with agents.\"}},\n",

However, chat completions take a conversation history as input, instead of a single prompt,         which enables the LLM to create responses that take past context into account.\\n\\n### Messages\\nThe primary input to the LLM is a list of messages represented by the `messages` array,         which forms the conversation.

[How to Fine-Tune GPT-3.5 Turbo With OpenAI API]( https://scale.com/blog/fine-tune-gpt-3.5)\\n        \\n\\n### Details\\n\\nBefore creating a model, you must first create a model template. A model template serves 2 purposes. First, it provides  common scaffolding that is static across multiple models. Second, it exposes several variables that can be injected at model creation time to customize the model.\\n\\nFor example, a model template can define a docker image that contains code to run a HuggingFace or SentenceTransformers model. This docker image code also accepts environment variables that can be set to swap out the model weights or model name. Refer to the Create Model Template API for more details.\\n\\nTo create a new model, users must refer to an existing model template and provide the necessary parameters the the model template requires in its `model_creation_parameters_schema` field. The combination of the model template and the model creation parameters will be used to create and deploy a new model.\\n\\nOnce a model has been created, it can be executed by calling the Execute Model API.\\n        \\n\\n\\n### Coming Soon\\nSome of our EGP APIs depend on models, for example Knowledge Base APIs depend on embedding models, Chunk Ranking APIs depend on ranking models, and Completion APIs depend on LLMs.\\n\\nIn the near future, if a model is created from a model template that is compatible with one of these APIs (based on the model template's `model_type field`), the model will automatically be registered with the API. This will allow users to immediately start using the model with those API without any additional setup.\"}},\n",
